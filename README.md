# Bryan Miranda | Developer Portfolio V2

A modern, fast, and minimalist portfolio built with Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Next-Intl for Internationalization.

## 🚀 Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Compiled statically with Next.js Server Components.
- **I18N Ready**: Dual language support (English and Portuguese) using `next-intl` cleanly integrated into the App Router middleware.
- **Modern Interactions**:
  - **SpotlightCards**: with radial mouse hover effects.
  - **Canvas Particles**: Interactive background particles using raw `<canvas>`.
  - **Revealing Typography**: Spring-based smooth text reveals on the Hero section.
  - **Scroll Progress**: A subtle tracking bar built via Framer metrics.
- **Fully Responsive**: Designed with mobile-first and fluid typography principles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: `Next.js 15` (React 19)
- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS v4`, `Lucide React`
- **Animations**: `Framer Motion`
- **Translations**: `Next-Intl`
- **Design System**: Monochrome, high contrast, clean component architecture.

## 💻 Local Development

2. Install dependencies:

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎨 Aesthetics & Architecture

The design leaves behind the overused "Glassmorphism & Neon" typical developer themes and adopts an editorial, monochrome approach with high contrast (`#09090b` for background and `#fafafa` for foreground), similar to premium SaaS applications.

- **Typography**: [Geist Sans & Mono](https://vercel.com/font).
- **Clean Structure**: Code split intuitively between functional sections (`Hero.tsx`, `Projects.tsx`) and logic/animation files.
